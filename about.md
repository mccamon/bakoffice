# bakoffice.org
> Helping Nonprofits make bigger impacts

Something needs to change. Each year, US nonprofits spend over $3 billion dollars on the back office software they need to run their operations. These hundreds of millions of dollars are being paid to very successful **for-profit** corporations, instead of directly supporting the core missions of nonprofits. bakoffice.org aims to revolutionize the efficiency and impact of the nonprofit sector.

bakoffice.org, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in its startup phase, is building and then will then host and license at **no cost**, three enterprise toolsets specifically designed for nonprofits including: 

1. Reports: Normalized Impact Reporting collected from the field and with automatic reporting for stakeholders
2. Engage: Tools and automations to engage stakeholders in real-time
3. Support: Online Giving, Team Fundraising, along with Donor and Volunteer Management

With over three decades combined expereince in leadership roles in non- and not-for-profit organizations, Mike and Jody McCamon are the co-founders of bakoffice.org.
